This is my first post written within Jekyll, which powers this site. It's static, which means I can host this using Google Cloud - as I have a lot of spare credit. Learning Jekyll means I have an excuse to learn markdown too which I guess will come in handy.

Since mid-2016 I have also worked for New Verve Consulting as a Sysops Engineer, working mainly with AWS services. Recently I have also been involved in devops working on plugins for the Atlassian ecosystem to work with their tools such as Jira and Confluence. I have been involved in the configuration and management of Atlassian tools for many outside clients as well as internal work.

Outside of work, I am also a full time Computing Science BSc. student at the University of Glasgow, currently in my final year. Currently I am working on a project involving a Baxter robot, the Oculus Rift/HTC Vibe VR headsets and control gear as well as deep learning for my final year.

I'm not sure what I will use this site for, hopefully I will do some write ups that others will find useful.
